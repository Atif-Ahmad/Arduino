Basic LCD Game

This game is a simple collision avoidance game on a 2x16 liquid crystal display. The player can only move up or down to avoid obstacles coming towards them. There are, at most, two obstacles on the screen at a time. Every time the player successfully avoids an obstacle, the score increases, and after a specific score, the game speeds up. The game is controlled by four buttons with an active buzzer for sound effects. The game has a start menu, can be paused, and has a game over screen. The game keeps track of your high score, and while playing, the game displays your score in the rightmost columns of the liquid crystal display.

Schematic was made using Fritzing.

The liquid crystal display shows the gameboard as the user performs different actions. The wiring of the LCD can be found on the official Arduino website: https://docs.arduino.cc/learn/electronics/lcd-displays/. The LCD uses the LiquidCrystal.h header file, which is included here. There are four buttons towards the right. The leftmost button is for starting the game and resuming if paused. The second and third buttons move the player up or down, respectively. The rightmost button is used to pause the game. There is also an active buzzer used to play sounds. The buzzer works through an input voltage and time delay. It also plays a sound at the start menu and at the game over screen. A section of the code runs continuously in a loop until the power is cut off. In this loop, the program constantly checks if a button is pressed and updates the board. If a button is pressed it will send a signal to the arduino pin and execute the appropriate action. The program uses the time to set the speed of the moving obstacle, increasing the speed from a second to half a second, and so on.
