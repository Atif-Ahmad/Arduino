# Arduino
Basic programs using Arduino and my knowledge of circuits. All programs were used on an Arduino Uno.

The LCD Alarm code contains the main file, two support libraries, and two images of the circuit's wiring. The alarm utilizes the Arduino's Liquid Crystal Display. 

The code in Speaker is a simple program that plays a tune. This is from one of Arduino's tutorials.

The programs in basic_circuits explore some of the basic components that come with the Arduino.
